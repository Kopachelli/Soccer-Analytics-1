## Welcome to the Soccer-Analytics...!

So Idea behind this project to visualize the Soccer players,Clubs progress rate in a cool and informative way.Similarly we will use machine learning to Predict the Player traits and ability of any player.

**Phase1:**  
* Player wise Data visualization by their traits. (Eg: Visualize the data by Top Great Long passer Players )  
* Clubs Wise Data Visualization.(Eg:Home Ground success rate, Away Success rate)

**Phase2:** **(Deep learning using TensorFlow)**

* Detect Which kind of player fit in the given Team. Here Tensorflow can do wonders.
* Predict the traits of young players.(Can he be good at passing in the future).
* Predict the Best Squad according to the opponent team.
